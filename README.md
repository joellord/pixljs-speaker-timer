# Pixl.js Speaker Timer
As a speaker gift at (Connect.tech)[https://connect.tech], we received a Pixl.js espruino.  So I figured, why not turn this into a speaker tool.  

This speaker timer will let you know when you talk is about to end, first by blinking the display and eventually, by flashing the back light. 

(Demo)[https://javascripteverything.com].


# Configuration
You can change line 1 to show your name instead.

Line 2 has the list of timers.  Each timer has a total duration in minutes as well at the blinking and flashing threshold.

# Installation
Go to the (Espruino IDE)[https://espruino.com/ide].  Click on the icon in the upper left corner.  Connect to your device.  Copy the code from speaker-timer.js in the IDE.  Click on the "flash to device" button.
